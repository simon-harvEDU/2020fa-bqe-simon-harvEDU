# BiologyQueryEnhancer - BQE 
## Abstract
With the Biology Query Enhancer I am developing a tool for Biologists and Bioinformaticians to effectively search and query the two major biological and medical data bases for literature and knowledge: *pubmed* and *biorxiv*. The tool is made to query multiple questions to *both* data bases. The output can be either a csv data frame or a word cloud as a graphical output. The search is quering the abstract and the text. Both tools are inspired by and using code from Biopython and https://github.com/blairbilodeau/arxiv-biorxiv-search
